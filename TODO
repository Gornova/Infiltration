	spunti grafica:
	
	Hi! You will find the font we used here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/eb-garamond …. In general this website https://www.dafont.com/fr/theme.php?cat=401 … is a good resource for font. But if you want to publish your game, be careful that the one you plan to use is also okay for commercial use (most of them are). About paper textures we used this huge database: https://www.textures.com/category/paper/16217 …. If you login, you can download up to 15 images per day. Best, Aurelien
	

		- colorare l'icona del distretto dorata se posseduta da un png ?
		- in progress interpolazione usando lerp: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-linear-interpolation-in-ui-animations-74701eb9957c

focus sui png e sulle loro azioni.
non possederli direttamente, ma poter forzare le loro azioni (aumentandone il peso relativo) rispetto ad una lista.
es. il png vorrebbe reclutare, tu gli dici: no vai ed uccidi X
chiaro per sbloccare le azioni più pesanti va implementato un sistema a punti, così all'inizio non puoi forzare una tua marionetta a fare tutto.
tipo l'idea del destino che guida a fare certe azioni e certe no.


Archifenix ideas:
- Ideas: "Regime purge".: Make it so instead of rebellions going on forever, they reduce the population a bit and purge all characters who own districts as well as purchasing food so a new rebellion is not as likely to occur.
- "Everybody on edge": If population is at 1000, a revolt does not happen (as that would effectively result in a depopulated city), but the unrest does as the idea name says and so agents are much more likely to be discovered. If they are found out, they are lynched, reducing unrest as the government uses them as escapegoats.
- "Time for peace": After a new regime takes over, cut unrest in half, 2/3, or do away with it entirely.

-------

idea alternativa/test: fare un gioco dove controlli solo questo come meccanica core, tipo roguelike dove c'è il villaggio, le persone e tu le manipoli dall'ombra!





	e se fosse da far partire il giocatore con un solo png corrotto e pronto a fare quello che vuole => ed il potere è bloccato finché è in vita o lo libera?

	fare dei tag unici per ogni partita che prende un solo png, con bassa probabilità
	il destino o "path" è il modo col quale i png affontano i problemi: chi sempre con la forza, chi con l'intelligenza, nonostante la classe, la follia li fa andare fuori dal loro percorso
	orrori che sono sbloccabili da parte del giocatore se fa fare certe quest ai png, orrori poi che operano nei poi: e vengono attaccati in automatico se lanciati all'assalto!
	se un png è pazzo abbastanza crea un culto che cerca di aiutarti.. a modo suo, evocando mostri e creando caos!
		
	That said, it feels very random at the moment, you either manage to be lucky enough to subvert a location with the needed clues or the nations fall in civil war and you cannot search for clues in them, so the game turns unwinnable. Still, for a 0.0.6 it has more functionality than TWS ever had, player-wise.
	
	- se un attore si impossessa di un district che è dominato da un altro che è puppet del giocatore ed è in calling
		allora il calling si blocca => evento per il giocatore
	- portraits and NPC are now synced, no more male portrait for females!


	- aggiungere poi e distretti nascosti ?
	

	- new districts and quests:
		- library
		- prison
		- observatory
		- graveyard
		- monastery
		- slums - bassifondi
		- noble quarter
		- arena (combattimenti)
		- miniera


domande alle qual irispondere:

- What’s the first thing someone sees when they start your game?
- What does the first interaction with the controls feel like?
- How does the scope of the game open up within the first hour — how does it demonstrate its depth to the player?
- When does the game start to get boring — why would I keep playing once I’ve learned the basics?
- Can I imagine someone playing my game for fifty hours? What would it take to help them get there — what is the value going to be for them?

BACKLOG:
	- ci sono casualmente dei landmark (creati da un pool iniziale, tipo carte), o poi che compaiono quando succedono certe condizioni o eventi e ci sono delle quest alle quali puoi mandare gli npc che hai corrotto abbastanza tramite il calling
		poi si vede il movimento delle unità
			e da li sblocchi dei potenziamenti per la tua religione, che danno bonus o tag ai tuoi seguaci abbastanza corrotti o folli
	- VALutare https://www.stomt.com/
	- le nazioni avanzano verso la civilizzazione e tu le combatti per riportarle verso le barbarie, l'ignoranza e la superstizione, così il tuo potere è maggiore
	- e le azioni che il giocatore fa fare ai png.. finiscono nelle quest fatte => e bloccano la simulazione sotto, di fatto il png è occupato a fare altro..
	- question mark ? left icons with different colors for different type of events: quests, triggered, characters, positive and negative for player
	- preview screen for every action on actors => modifiers from events, districts, world, actors, random etc.. tags for handling that ?

	- le crisi non sono generate a caso (es. ribellioni, poco cibo, piaghe), ma da scelte dei png e del pg attraverso i png
	- capire cosa succede dopo che ribelli/loyalisti si scontrano: effetti su rapporti tra città, gilde, personaggi, cosa fanno i personaggi e se li rende più manipolabili
	- connect districts and clues: a character in power of a district where clues is get a bonus ? need to think about this!
	- aggiungere una descrizione che cambia della città in base al suo stato ? => si può ottenere anche con un'icona, riportandola dalla mappa principale anche nel dettaglio della città
	
	- BUG: double calling on focused hero.. with one power!
	
	- manipulation outcome: I want to add more information about possible manipulation outcome. Do to it my idea is to add a panel when user decide to start a manipulation on a character against another character and using madness stat, preview to player the possible outcome (with a percentage, because player does not have total control)
	- complicate victory: follow ideas before, add a chance (10% for first power to obtain, more for the following) that an organization or character uncover the secret and alter the equilibrium in the world (factions, relations), so player must find a way to "manipulate" this target in the right way
	- events and consequences: I want to find a way for an event to "tag" (and display on ui) a poi with a permanent modifier, so player can see how certain events impact on a poi. An example is +2 rebellion, famine, etc..
			

	issue testo tagliato: per riprodurlo lancio, clicco sull'icona della città, clicco sul PG, clicco su focus. ecco la screen

	Quello che faticavo a capire nella meccanica era il meccanismo per cui dovevo usare una skill e poi fare avanti di turno. In giochi a turno ho visto fare cose del tipo uso i miei punti...quando non posso fare altro l'icona del potere è grigia (non posso più usarlo) e posso soltanto fare fine turno (magari segnalandolo).			
			


Ideas:
	- avere un'opzione in avvio che permetta di far partire col mondo già avanti in simulazione? Bobby2Hand diceva che nel suo gioco, faceva andare 100 turni prima di far andare il gioco
	- calendario, stagioni, eventi eccezionali come terremoti, maremoti ecc.. 
	- colored console hightlight cities, characters, districts and quests
	- different event icons for events
	- skill / missions to guide players => use focus 10 time => unlock puppet action ?
	- guild alignment with government vs not so aligned => rebellion wins ? kill character in loyalist forces
	- focus/time mechanics for government: every X turns advance on a subject (law/war/peace), different government, different subjects possible, more complex government => more time required
	- character mood (depression/euphoria) => if player force on character to do something that character hates => less mood, something love => more mood. Hate/likes => based on traits. Mood is a bonus/malus on certain actions
	- willpower? first forced actions are easy => then character will become a puppet on your hand
	- non-human characters ? for example extraplanar entities ?  older races like mi-go ?
